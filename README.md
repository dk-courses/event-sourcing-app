# Event Sourcing with Spring Boot and Apache Kafka

This is an application which shows an easy principle for event sourcing with Spring Boot and Apache Kafka.

The test part is based on the blog post [Testing an Apache Kafka Integration within a Spring Boot Application](https://blog.mimacom.com/testing-apache-kafka-with-spring-boot/).

For running the application you need a running Kafka instance  with the default configuration.
In case Kafka is running on a different port, you need to use the Spring Boot Kafka properties to adapt the configuration.
